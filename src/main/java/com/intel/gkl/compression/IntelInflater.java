/**
 * This is a copy of java.util.zip.Deflater from OpenJDK 7, with the following changes:
 * - package and class name changed
 * - static block to load libIntelGKL library
 * - extends java.util.zip.Inflater so that IntelInflater object can be used as regular Inflater object.
 *   Note however that all methods of Inflater are overridden.
 *
 * The shared library is packaged is a jar file and is loaded when GKL_USE_LIB_PATH is set.
 *
 *
 * The rest of this document is copied verbatim from the original OpenJDK file.
 *
 * This class provides support for general purpose compression using the
 * popular ZLIB compression library. The ZLIB compression library was
 * initially developed as part of the PNG graphics standard and is not
 * protected by patents. It is fully described in the specifications at
 * the <a href="package-summary.html#package_description">java.util.zip
 * package description</a>.
